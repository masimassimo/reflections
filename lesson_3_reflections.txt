Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:I think that i would use a remote repository when i want to share my files on the web. I can use the remote repository also like a cloud,
to have access at my file from any computer.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:Because i want to upload the files when i made a set of significative changes
