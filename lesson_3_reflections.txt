Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:I think that i would use a remote repository when i want to share my files on the web. I can use the remote repository also like a cloud,
to have access at my file from any computer.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:Because i want to upload the files when i made a set of significative changes

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A:The forks are copy of the repository on github used to have a mine version without touch the original; clones are copies of a repository on github on my local computer; branches are a copy of my local repository used to make alternative projects or experiment without affect original files.
